## Clinical State Measurement Architecture

Intervals, Functional Refractory Periods, and Effective Refractory Periods are
Clinical State-specific data. Each Clinical State owns its own context,
measurements, and ERP-card presentation state.

Switching Clinical States must display that state's distinct:

- intervals
- Functional Refractory Periods
- Effective Refractory Periods
- Accessory Pathway 2 visibility state

No measurement values are shared globally between Clinical States.

### Clinical State creation

The action for creating a Clinical State is a compact button labeled `NEW`
beside the `ACTIVE CLINICAL STATE` label. The Case Structure rail is reserved
for Clinical State navigation.

## Effective Refractory Period Card

Effective Refractory Periods use a dedicated, compact, responsive card rather
than the generic single-measurement grid.

Each ERP is represented by three numerical input components:

`value 1 / value 2 / value 3 ms`

The inputs must remain visibly outlined and large enough for three-digit values.

ERP values are stored as predictable component keys:

- `erp.<field>.1`
- `erp.<field>.2`
- `erp.<field>.3`

For reports, summaries, exports, and diagnostic processing, trailing blank
components are omitted and values are normalized with slash separators.

Examples:

- `600`, `300`, `300` becomes `600/300/300`
- `600`, `300`, blank becomes `600/300`
- blank values are never converted to zero

## Rhythm-Specific ERP Display Rules

### Atrial Pacing

The ERP card badge displays `Antegrade`.

ERP fields appear in this order:

1. Fast Pathway
2. Slow Pathway
3. Accessory Pathway 1
4. Accessory Pathway 2, when added
5. AV Node
6. Atrial

Accessory Pathway 2 is hidden initially. An `Add` button appears next to
Accessory Pathway 1. Selecting it reveals Accessory Pathway 2 for the active
Clinical State and then removes the Add button.

### Ventricular Pacing

The ERP card badge displays `Retrograde`.

ERP fields appear in this order:

1. Accessory Pathway 1
2. Accessory Pathway 2, when added
3. Retrograde
4. Ventricular

Accessory Pathway 2 follows the same state-specific Add behavior.

### Presentation-state ownership

Whether Accessory Pathway 2 has been added belongs to the individual Clinical
State. One state may display it while another state does not. Switching states
must restore the ERP card exactly as it was configured for that state.

The full ERP field definitions remain available in the domain model. The ERP
card derives its visible fields and ordering through rhythm-specific display
rules rather than deleting fields from the underlying model.
